# Banking-Application

1. Developed a C++ application simulating bank service operations, employing data structures such as queues and
   priority queues to manage event-driven simulations
   
2. Achieved over 200% efficient runtime performance by implementing a binary heap to prioritize events
 
3. Integrated multiple ADTs into a coherent application, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of queue
   theory and its practical application in event simulation

#  Explanation
I actively developed a ”Banking Application” that can effectively manage people coming to the bank in
collaboration with two students. I wanted to effectively set priorities in various situations, and through
in-depth discussions with my team members, I implemented a binary heap in the code and completed
an application that achieved 200% efficiency. In the process, I tried to maximize the practicality of the
code by packaging the data structure and its operations using ADTs that match the binary heap and
hide internal details.
