# Banking-Application

1. Developed a C++ application simulating bank service operations, employing data structures such as queues and
   priority queues to manage event-driven simulations
2. Achieved over 200% efficient runtime performance by implementing a binary heap to prioritize events
3. Integrated multiple ADTs into a coherent application, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of queue
   theory and its practical application in event simulation
